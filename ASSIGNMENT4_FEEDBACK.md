Hi Pernilla!

Amazing! Absolutely the love the night/day selector.

+1 for adding an alt in the js to the img tag. I think yoou are the only student who hasn't recieved an "add alts to images" comment!

The only comment I have is that occasionally the text for a hero is greater than the 560px of the text container, so it overflows and breaks the layout slightly. overflow: scroll or making the height flexible should solve this.

Search "Wolfsbane" to see this - coincidentally I had a big Xmen phase in my misspent youth and read some New Mutants comics, where she comes from! 

It's very obvious you have a passion and talent for coding, and an eye for design. You build great things.

Nothing else to say, 12/10, Välgodkänt!
